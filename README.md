# burger

In this assignment, we have created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The end result is a restaurant app where the user can devour and "undevour (???)" as many burgers as he desires.

Make sure you try Da B.I.G Burger!
